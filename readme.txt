Adds a block that lists yarpp related posts. 

== Description ==

Adds a block that lists yarpp related posts. Also provides an option to display the latest posts without the related posts. Works best with full site editing themes.

= Features =

* Gutenberg column width support.
* The block is not visible in the frontend if no related posts are found.
* Minimum html and css that is based on the standard Gutenberg Latest Posts block.
* Valid HTML output.
* Inherits the style of your theme for links and headlines.
